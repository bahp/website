    The <a href="https://bahp.github.io/portfolio-academic/projects/camonet/">Centres for Antimicrobial Optimisation Network (CAMO-Net)</a> 
    is a unique global research partnership which brings together institutions from Africa, Asia, 
    Europe and South America to optimise antimicrobial use globally. As part of this partnership, a 
    series of collaborative meetings between researchers from the 
    <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/">University of Liverpool (UOL)</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London (ICL)</a> are organised to discuss 
    the progress made within the 
    <a href="https://bahp.github.io/portfolio-academic/projects/camonet/">CAMO-Net</a> projects 
    around the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in healthcare. In this meeting, 
    researchers collectively delved into the latest developments and accomplishments and conducted 
    insightful discussions that will propel us further towards the transformative integration of AI 
    in healthcare.
