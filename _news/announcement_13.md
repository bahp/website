    In an open call, 18 PhD students from Indian and British higher education institutions were selected on 
    the basis of their motivation, experience and field of work to ensure interdisciplinarity and reach. The 
    students had the chance to attend a high profile series of seminars and discuss with international AMR experts 
    themes around AMR, diagnostics, innovation, interdisciplinary thinking, international collaboration and AMR DxC. 
    The Autumn School coincided with other AMR events in Scotland and we offered sponsored registrations for Autumn 
    School attendees to the FIS 2015: Action on Infection Conference in Glasgow (21-23 November).

<p align="justify">
    The main aims of the Autumn School were: (i) Promote interdisciplinary thinking and international collaboration 
    for AMR diagnostics, (ii) Identify potential ambassadors for team formations in UK and India for the 2016 AMR 
    DxC competition, (iii) Promote interaction between potential AMR DxC competitors and the AMR experts and (iv)
    Identify the overall feasibility AMR DxC for the participants and the organisers.
