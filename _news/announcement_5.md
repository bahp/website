    Imperial Tech Foresight is a futures practice at Imperial College London. We develop foresight thinking that 
    span the possible, probable and plausible, researching the fringes of disruption and breakthrough technologies 
    assessing their potential impact on humans and society at large. We are innately curious and deeply questioning, 
    exploring underlying drivers and shifts in the world of scientific disruption. We work with partners across 
    industries and sectors to broaden our thinking. The practice uses different methods, developed in-house, to make 
    the future come alive for their partners, through bespoke foresight programmes, inspirational thought-leadership 
    pieces and stimulating events.
