    The <a href="https://bahp.github.io/portfolio-academic/projects/camonet/">Centres for Antimicrobial Optimisation Network (CAMO-Net)</a> 
    is a unique global research partnership which brings together institutions from Africa, Asia, 
    Europe and South America to optimise antimicrobial use globally. As part of this partnership, a 
    series of collaborative meetings between researchers from the 
    <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/">University of Liverpool (UOL)</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London (ICL)</a> are organised to discuss 
    the progress made within the 
    <a href="https://bahp.github.io/portfolio-academic/projects/camonet/">CAMO-Net</a> projects 
    around the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in healthcare. In this inaugural
    meeting, researchers from the institutions met for the first time and briefly described their 
    topics of research. Together, we embark on a journey to shape the future of medical technologies, 
    leveraging the expertise and synergies between our esteemed institutions.
