    Ten Imperial postdocs from across the College are on this year’s cohort and are expected to be joined 
    by an undergraduate engineering student from Cairo, Abdelrahman Salem Fawzy. Abdelrahman, winner of 
    <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/193087/imperial-working-encourage-green-tech-innovators/" style="opacity: 1; transition-property: none;">

    <a href="//www.imperial.ac.uk/techcelerate">Techelerate</a>&nbsp;combines the expertise of external industry with 
    the knowledge and <a href="//www.imperial.ac.uk/enterprise" style="opacity: 1; transition-property: none;">enterprise ecosystem</a> at Imperial. 
    The team includes Paul Sturrock and Janet Murray, who have extensive experience working with technology ventures 
    in Silicon Valley and internationally. Sturrock co-founded FFWD London, a pre-accelerator programme for early 
    stage startups, while Murray has coached Forbes 30 under 30 and UN Youth Assembly members. In addition, the 
    programme has invited a panel of external business professionals and investors to evaluate the progress of the 
    ventures throughout their journey.

<h5>School for Entrepreneurs</h5>
<p align="justify">
    The programme began this week with intensive training aiming to both teach entrepreneurial theory and refocus 
    the participants’ strategies to explore commercialisation. Dr Bernard Hernandez, a participant from the 
    <a href="//www.imperial.ac.uk/bio-inspired-technology">Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology</a>, said: 
    <em>"as a researcher I am used to focusing on the technology. This programme forces me to focus on the 
    customer and the users."</em> His colleague <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/nicolas.moser13" style="opacity: 1; transition-property: none;">
    Dr Nicolas Moser</a> added that it ensures they are <em>"considering all aspects of commercialisation, 
    particularly customer discovery."</em>
</p>
    
<p align="justify">
    The programme takes the participants out of their comfort zone in the academic setting and helps them transition 
    to interacting with customers and business people.
</p>

<h5>Engaging with customers and other stakeholders</h5>
<p align="justify">
    <em>"When you explain your idea, you use certain terminology that you know. However, you need to change the 
    way you speak in order to engage with the customers"</em> Dr Bernard explained. <em>"You see what people who 
    are not experts in the field don’t understand about your idea.’</em>
</p>

<p align="justify">
    This initial week of workshops led by Sturrock will prepare participants for the next stage, where they will 
    begin interviewing a broad range of stakeholders in their industries. They’ll be supported throughout this 
    time in a series of masterclasses, feedback sessions and business coaching from Murray. These initial sessions 
    have also given participants the opportunity to bond as a group, which is invaluable for networking and 
    development of their entrepreneurial skill set.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <em>"I feel like we’re a part of a community and we’ll be able to support each other going forwards"</em>
    explained <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.rouse">Dr Sarah Rouse</a>, a researcher in the 
    <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/life-sciences/">Department of Life Sciences</a>.
</p>

<h5>Continued Support</h5>
<p align="justify">
    Whilst the aim of the programme is to explore commercialisation, it is a first step on a longer entrepreneurial 
    journey. Many participants in the past have gone on to launch successful ventures, with the support and 
    opportunities from <a href="//www.imperial.ac.uk/enterprise/staff/">other departments in the Enterprise 
    Division</a>.
</p>

<h5>About Techcelerate</h5>
<p align="justify">

    postdocs working in the ‘deep tech’ industry the training and resources to explore the early stages of 
    commercialisation. The programme runs for three months and aims to give postdocs the opportunity and resource
