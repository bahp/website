    Over summer 2016, I completed a four week placement at University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa. During 
    the first week I attended the Global Health Fellows Programme jointly organized by ICL and UCT which I strongly
    recommend. The Division of Infectious Diseases and HIV Medicine kindly hosted me for further research and 
    collaborations for the following three weeks.

    Within the Global Health Fellows Programme I was part of a group of approximately 30 students from Imperial 
    College, University of Cape Town and other entities in Africa. It was a wonderful opportunity to learn from 
    other people’s cultures and experiences. I would like to emphasize the generosity of African students, especially 
    from rural areas, whose main reason to pursue a PhD is to improve quality of life in nearby villages. From the 
    collaboration, I gained insights about current research projects within the department of medicine at UCT and 
    the health system in South Africa. Thankfully, interesting proposals for further collaboration were identified 
    and I might be back some day… fingers crossed!

    Since not all is work… life in Cape Town is very different to what we are used to in London. People are generally 
    very welcoming, helpful and chatty; the word rush is not in their dictionary. We spent some time exploring the 
    city which is simply amazing, especially to practise outdoors activities. Among my favourites were incredible 
    hikes in Table Mountain and outstanding surf beaches. In addition, make time for the garden route, an amazing 
    road trip to enjoy nature and wild life. For food enthusiasts, there is a wide variety of exotic meats and 
    seafood at really affordable prices. For wine enthusiasts… more than 250 wineries to visit, may your livers 
    survive the trip!
