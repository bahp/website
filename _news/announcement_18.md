    Happy to have joined the Ambassadors Team for the Robotic Summer School at Imperial College. It
    has been a pleasure to welcome such fantastic group of bright minds and showing them our campus 
    and the research facilities at our department. And the best of all...  we got to enjoy so many 
    social activities together! Just to mention a few of them... boat trip to Greenwich, ride on the
    London Eye, and delicious Korean food!
