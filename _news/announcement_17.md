    The purpose of the International Conference on Health Informatics is to bring together 
    researchers and practitioners interested in the application of information and communication 
    technologies (ICT) to healthcare and medicine in general and to the support of persons with 
    special needs in particular.<br> Databases, networking, graphical interfaces, data mining, 
    machine learning, intelligent decision support systems and specialized programming languages 
    are just a few of the technologies and research areas currently contributing to medical informatics. 
    Mobility and ubiquity in healthcare systems, physiological and behavioural modeling, standardization 
    of technologies and procedures, certification, privacy and security are some of the issues that 
    medical informatics professionals and the ICT industry and research community in general are 
    addressing in order to further promote ICT in healthcare. In the case of medical rehabilitation 
    and assistive technology, research in and applications of ICT have contributed greatly to the 
    enhancement of quality of life and full integration of all citizens into society.
