    The <a href="https://bahp.github.io/portfolio-academic/projects/camonet/">Centres for Antimicrobial Optimisation 
    Network (CAMO-Net)</a> is a unique global research partnership which brings together institutions from Africa, 
    Asia, Europe and South America to optimise antimicrobial use globally. With the aim of strengthening strategies, 
    fostering collaborations, and sharing knowledge, this partnership conducts a series of collaborative meetings 
    between researchers from the different organizations on a regular basis.

<p> Workshop 01: Data and dashboards in the context of AMR </p>

<p align="justify">
    The aim of this workshop is guide participants through the essentials of dashboard 
    design, specifically tailored for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) data visualization. 
    The session begins with a introduction to key dashbaord design patterns. Afterwards,
    participants have the opportunity to explore existing AMR dashboards, examining 
    data requirements, features, design choices, and common challenges. The workshop 
    culminates in a hands-on activity where participants, will collaboratively design 
    their own AMR dashboards. This includes discussions on data and information display,
    creating dashboard sketches, and presenting their designs for feedback. All the 
    material is included at the end of the page.

<p align="justify">
   To conclude, see the below video generously shared by Prof. David Aanensen, which 
   provides a brief demonstration of some of the tools and dashboards developed by the 
   Centre for Genomic Pathogenic Surveillance to display various types of AMR data. 
   Register your interest <a href="https://forms.gle/VgpGCB7PES6GG2dq9">here</a> to 
   attend the upcoming webinar by David Aanensen, Director of the Centre for Genomic
   Pathogenic Surveillance.
