    The "Pregnancy Care" app is a user-friendly web application developed specifically
    for midwives to streamline and organize the antenatal care process. This application
    empowers midwives to efficiently manage the care plans of pregnant individuals, ensuring 
    comprehensive and personalized support throughout their pregnancy journey.

    The application leverages the power of JavaScript and utilizes the indexedDB technology 
    to create a small yet robust database within the midwife's browser. This allows midwives 
    to store and access important information related to each pregnant individual's antenatal 
    care plan quickly and conveniently, regardless of their internet connection.
