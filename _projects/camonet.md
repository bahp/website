<p align="justify">    
    The Centres for Antimicrobial Optimisation Network (CAMO-Net) is a unique global research partnership
    which brings together institutions from Africa, Asia, Europe and South America to optimise antimicrobial
    use globally. With up to £11m in funding from <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a>, 
    this ground-breaking consortium will support translational research to address major drivers of 
    antimicrobial resistance, using a bespoke funding model to help enhance global health research equity. 
    The consortium brings together research teams from five national hubs; the 
    <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/">University of Liverpool (UOL)</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London (ICL)</a> in the UK, the 
    <a href="">Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS)</a> and the 
    <a href="">Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)</a> in India, 
    <a href="https://uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town (UCT)</a> in South Africa, the 
    <a href="https://idi.mak.ac.ug/">Infectious Diseases Institute</a> in Uganda, and the Faculty of 
    Medicine at the <a href="https://www5.usp.br/">University of São Paulo (USP)</a> in Brazil. These national
    hubs are built on existing collaborations and bring world class researchers together to address the
    global threat of AMR with local expertise. 
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
    The five national hubs are supported by three technical support and development centres. These  
    quality-assured technology, research and development laboratories that support CAMO-Net activities
    are: the 
    <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">University of Ghana</a> in Ghana, the 
    <a href="https://kcn.unima.mw/">Kamuzu University</a> in Malawi and the 
    <a href="https://www.tropmedres.ac/">Mahidol Oxford Research Unit (MORU)</a> Tropical Health Network in
    Thailand.
</p>

<p align="justify"> 
    Finally, the consortium includes three shadow national sites: the 
    <a href="https://www.duhs.edu.pk/">Dow University of Health Sciences</a> in Pakistan, the 
    <a href="https://chrfbd.org/">Child Health Research Foundation</a> in Bangladesh and 
    <a href="https://www.unpaz.tl/">Universidade da Paz</a> in Timor-Leste. This shadow national sites 
    participate in network activities to actively build research collaborations and capacity with the 
    national hubs. Our shadow national sites are currently identifying national research priorities and 
    will then conduct a pilot project. The goal for a future iteration of CAMO-Net is that shadow national 
    sites would become National Hubs, and new shadow sites would be identified.

<p align="justify">
    The mission of CAMO-Net is to complement and enhance the existing ecosystem of global programmes 
    designed to alleviate the global burden and impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and poorly 
    treated infections by creating and nurturing a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for global 
    research to optimise the use of antimicrobials in humans. This will be achieved through producing 
    contextually relevant tools, technologies, guidelines, and practices that can be readily implemented 
    with the support of governments and policymakers.
