<b>Role:</b> Consultant or advisor on AI/ML in health care.

<p align="justify">
    The aim of the project is to create a small, accessible booklet in a zine format 
    illustrating the key ideas behind the use of data, AI, decision-support for dengue 
    with a low- and middle-income country (LMIC) focus and all the challenges which come 
    with it. We want to touch on specific topics which might include bias, accountability, 
    responsible innovation in a resource-limited context and data use. At the end perhaps 
    a small checklist or call to action for important and/or interesting points to consider.
