    The aim of this project is improving upon the initial rule-based model and providing 
    personalised decision support using individual level data specifically for patients in 
    intensive care through the use of Case-Based Reasoning. (the ENIAPP project)
</p>

<p align="justify">
    This project involved 18 months of work including: stakeholder requirements gathering; workflow 
    modelling; medical decision making analysis from critical care and infection specialists; mapping of 
    existing and required information systems; and finally, an adaptive software development process. 
    Clinico-physiological and demographic parameters influencing infection management were categorised and 
    integrated into the case-based reasoning algorithm, and definitions of antimicrobial regime success and 
    failure were developed.
</p>

    The final product, ENhanced Imperial Antibiotic Prescribing Policy app (ENIAPP) has been developed as an 
    mHealth application for use on mobile tablets with information governance assured through use of the App 
    as a thin client, and all communication between the App and the central servers is within secure hospital 
    firewalls. Pilot data on 50 clinical cases showed 100% accurate retrieval of patient demographic, clinical 
    and  pathology data from disparate NHS information systems.
