<b>Role:</b> Postdoctoral researcher

<p align="justify;">
    Vietnam ICU Translational Applications Laboratory (VITAL) is a unique multidisciplinary project, 
    funded by the <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> as part of its Innovations 
    for Impact strategy, providing ICU/critical care innovation in resource-limited settings. The 
    project is a collaboration between The <a href="http://www.bvbnd.vn/">Hospital for Tropical 
    Diseases (HTD)</a> and <a href="http://www.oucru.org/">Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU)</a>, 
    in Ho Chi Minh City, the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London (ICL)</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/">Kingâ€™s College London (KCL)</a>, 
    <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">the University of Melbourne</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The project brings together clinicians, biomedical engineers, physiotherapists, 
    computational and social scientists aiming to use innovative approaches to improve the
    care of critically ill patients in low and middle income settings, focusing on diseases 
    which cause significant morbidity and mortality.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The project aims to use state-of-the-art ways to enhance diagnosis and treatment utilizing 
    machine learning, novel technologies and computational science in 4 specific diseases: 
    sepsis, dengue, tetanus and tuberculous meningitis, using low-cost tools that are suitable 
    use in the management of other life-threatening conditions and for scale-up and use in a 
    wider setting. <a href="http://vital.oucru.org/research-setting/"> Read more </a>

<!--
The team will be based in the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) ICU in Ho Chi Minh 
city and provide proof-of-principle that bioengineering and artificial intelligence can 
be used to define physiology and inform clinical decision making in the treatment of 
the commonest life-threatening infectious diseases (dengue shock, septic shock, tetanus,
TB meningitis).
