    The "ProtonDx TimerHUB" app is a user-friendly web application developed specifically
    for <a href="https://www.protondx.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDX</a> diagnostic test 
    users to provide a collection of timers to streamline, organize and enhance productivity.

    The application leverages the power of JavaScript and utilizes the indexedDB technology 
    to create a small yet robust database within the users browser. It can be used in the
    browser but also implements Progressive Web App (PWA) technology, to allow "installation" 
    of the app for offline use.
