    This repository contains a diverse collection of sample <code>javascript</code> 
    projects that have been gathered from a variety of sources, including official 
    documentation sites or common sites where programmers post question, answers 
    and/or tutorials. Additionally, the scripts have been edited by the repository 
    owner to make them more comprehensive or tailored to specific use cases and
    visualisations.
