  abstract={The aim of this workshop is guide participants through the essentials of dashboard
    design, specifically tailored for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) data visualization.
    The session begins with a introduction to key dashbaord design patterns. Afterwards,
    participants have the opportunity to explore existing AMR dashboards, examining
    data requirements, features, design choices, and common challenges. The workshop
    culminates in a hands-on activity where participants, will collaboratively design
    their own AMR dashboards. This includes discussions on data and information display,
    creating dashboard sketches, and presenting their designs for feedback.}

  abstract={This presentation explores the transformative potential of leveraging time series
  dependencies through advanced machine learning techniques in the clinical management of acute
  febrile illnesses. It explores the use of machine learning models, such as Recurrent Neural
  Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict bloodstream infections based on temporal data
  and highlights the potential of real-time monitoring systems that enhance early detection,
  diagnosis, and treatment strategies. To conclude, it discusses a study using photoplethysmogram
  (PPG) signals to predict Dengue patient outcomes and risk, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network
  (CNN) and multimodal data fusion. The presentation argues for the importance of considering time series
  dependencies and the increasing availability of data when developing machine learning models
  to facilitate personalized and timely interventions, ultimately contributing to more effective healthcare
  outcomes.}

  abstract={This presentation discusses the challenges and limitations of diagnosing severe bacterial infections,
  specifically sepsis, using data-driven approaches and emphasizes the importance of considering past medical
  history and co-morbidities, as well as continuous measurement and re-evaluation of diagnoses. It also
  highlights the need to define a consistent reference standard for serious bacterial infections and the potential
  use of machine learning diagnostics from various data streams, including electronic health records. To conclude,
  it acknowledges the complexities and unanswered questions related to the application, implementation,
  interpretability, and complexity of developing a model for accurately predicting bacterial infections.}

  abstract={This presentation discusses the challenges of diagnosing and providing support for Dengue disease,
  a mosquito-borne illness, in tropical and subtropical regions where data may be limited and emphasizes the
  importance of efficient resource allocation. An unsupervised approach based on case-based reasoning combined
  with a 2D embedding space representation is proposed to identify similar cases and learn from their outcomes.
  Various techniques are explored to generate the embbedings, including PCA, T-SNE, UMAP, and self-organizing maps,
  ultimately settling on an Autoencoder algorithm. The latent space produced is thoroughly explained demonstratring
  that the results align with established clinical characteristics exhibited by patients with dengue infection,
  as well as features of disease progression. Furthermore, similar clinical phenotypes are represented close to each
  other in the latent space and clustered according to outcomes broadly described by the World Health
  Organisation dengue guidelines. To conclude, these findings are included into a clinical decision support
  system to support monitoring and management of dengue and other febrile illness.}

  abstract={The presentation provides an update on simulation strategies including agent-based,
  discrete event simulation and other system dynamics. It specifically shows the use of agent-based
  modeling for social unrest simulation and discrete event simulation for hospital processes. It also
  provides a demo of a discrete event simulation system of a hospital where patients are
  registered as events with specific event times, executed when the time counter reached the event
  times, and removed once completed. Overall, these simulation methods offer valuable insights into
  complex systems like hospitals, social unrest, and other applications.}
